Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to derive meaningful insights. The dataset contains transaction-level details, including customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and timestamps.

The analysis includes:

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Time Series Analysis (Monthly & Daily Sales Trends)

Customer & Product Insights

Sales Distribution Analysis

Correlation & Pattern Discovery

Advanced Visualizations (Heatmaps, Treemaps, Boxplots, and Pie Charts)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of the following key columns:

Date: Transaction timestamp

Customer ID: Unique identifier for customers

Product Category: Type of product purchased

Quantity: Number of items purchased

Total Amount: Revenue generated from the purchase

Age & Gender: Demographics of the customer

ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations & Insights

The analysis is powered by Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, offering both static and interactive visualizations.

ðŸ”¹ Sales Trends Over Time

Line charts for daily and monthly sales trends to identify seasonal patterns.

Time Series Decomposition to extract trend, seasonality, and residual components.

ðŸ”¹ Customer & Product Analytics

Product Category Distribution to understand the most popular product types.

Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis to identify high-value segments.

ðŸ”¹ Correlation & Distribution

Heatmaps to visualize relationships between numerical features.

Sales Distribution Analysis using histograms and KDE plots.

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Visualizations

Treemap for hierarchical visualization of sales by product category.

Scatter & Boxplots for quantity vs. sales relationship analysis.

Pie Charts for sales contribution breakdown by category.

âš¡ Setup & Installation

To run this analysis, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly statsmodels kaleido

Additionally, if you're using Jupyter Notebook, enable inline plotting:

%matplotlib inline

ðŸš€ Running the Code

Execute the Python script (eda_retail_sales.py) using:

python eda_retail_sales.py

Or run the cells in a Jupyter Notebook for an interactive experience.
